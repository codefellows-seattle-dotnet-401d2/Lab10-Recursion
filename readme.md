# Towers of Hanoi Calculator

the Towers of Hanoi is a logic puzzle. A stack of discs stands on one of three baseplates. Each disc is smaller than the one it sits on top of. Move all discs to another baseplate without moving more than one at a time, without placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one, and each disc must be above one of the baseplates.

There is a minimum number of moves to accomplish the task based on how many discs are added. This calculator takes an integer you define and finds the number of moves using two methods.

Run the program and you will be prompted to enter an integer. After that, both numbers will be returned.

Press enter at this point to end the program.
